`react-emojify-image` uses ES2015+ `import/export` syntax, and other features.</br>
Meaning, you have to use a bundler of some sort along with the package, but nowadays who doesn't?

#### props

name | type | default | required | description
---- | :----: | :-------: | :--------: | -----------
**image** | ImageBitmap |  | yes | An ImageBitmap object of the actual image to use.</br></br>The easiest way to get this object is to use `createImageBitmap()`.</br></br>It gets an image source, which can be an <img>, SVG <image>, <video>, OffscreenCanvas, or <canvas> element, a Blob, ImageData, or another ImageBitmap object.
**scale** | Number | 15 | no | The number of (scale X scale) pixels to replace with one emoji.
**loader** | Function | `() => <span>Loading...</span>` | no | The loader component to render when either remapping colors to emojis or when emojifying the image.

### FAQ
* > How can I load other emojis?
  * Simple! you can use `import { EmojifyImageCustom } from 'react-emojify-image'`. It's the same thing but it also has an `emojis` prop which is an array of strings. </br> This serves as the list of emojis to use when reconstructing the image.
* > This package is really big! can you make it smaller?
  * Well, this concerns the last question. You can supply a different set of emojis to use. Also, this was built in a way that tree-shaking can do it's magic. if you'll load `EmojifyImageCustom` you won't get the entire list of predefined emojis, making this rather small.
* > What are the supported browsers on this thing?
  * Chrome and Firefox. Unfortunately Safari doesn't support `ImageBitmap` which is used here as a base class to create all image types.</br>
  Maybe later support for other browsers will be added.
* > Hmmm... but why?
  * Why not?
